James left high school as one of the most hyped prospects in NBA history.
Upon entering the NBA, he made an immediate impact and was voted Rookie of the Year in his debut season.
As of June 2021, he has been named to 17 All-NBA Teams, including 13 times to the first-team, which are both NBA records. 
His four MVP awards are matched only by Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only players to win four MVP awards in a five-year span. 
James has also won four Finals MVP Awards, which is the second-most all-time, and earned All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014. 
While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals.
His teams have appeared in the Finals ten times and won four championships. 
His ten Finals appearances are tied for third all-time.
Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have countered that James usually performed well but his team was defeated by superior competition.
